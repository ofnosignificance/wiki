# NEC PC-98

The PC98 was a series of computers produced by the NEC Corporation sold
on the Japanese market and are to this day known as a series with a
plethora of games made for them.

## Emulators

Currently there are multiple emulators to choice from when it comes to
the PC98, however they vary in quality. Dosbox-X is reported to have
less accurate emulation, whereas Neko Project 21/W is the go-to for PC98
emulation. There is also Neko Project II which is closed-source, unlike
Neko Project 21/W. Other emulators are not really useful and more of a
historical note herein rather than actually software you would like to
play your games on. [This website](https://pc98.ne.jp/emu/) offers a
good overview of the various PC98 emulators available.
