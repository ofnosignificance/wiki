## Playing Stronghold on Linux {#playing_stronghold_on_linux}

You can get the setup exe file from anywhere you want, I got it from
GOG, since it was dirt-cheap at the time, doesn\'t have DRM, and offers
the classic Stronghold game. Unlike what certain websites try to tell
you, you don\'t need any additional tools or software other than Wine
itself, although it might work better with Steam\'s Proton. The game
works well enough with standard Wine; just run the setup executable
through it and follow through the installation process. The game itself
runs fine, even on old hardware, even though it does have some bugs,
that might or might not be similar on Windows: 1. All my desktop icons
on Xfce4 reorder themselves when starting the game. 2. When starting the
game, it starts glitching a bit, but once the first logo appears, this
doesn\'t seem to be the case anymore.
