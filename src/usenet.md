# Usenet

The Usenet is a decentralized communications network built on top of the
NNTP, which has been around for practically 5ever. These days the Usenet
faded into obscurity, while it used to be the biggest network of it\'s
kind way back in the 80s and is of \"cultural\" significance for what
would later become Internet culture, netiquette, and vocabulary. To read
Usenet posts you need a newsreader and a Usenet provider, both of which
can be obtained at no cost for the most part. The various newsgroups,
think the places where the actual communication is facilitated, are
sorted into various hierarchies (the major ones: comp.\*, humanities.\*,
misc.\*, news.\*, alt.\*, rec.\*, sci.\*, soc.\*, talk.\*, and
additionally you got regional ones like es.\*, japan.\*, de.\*, or other
specific ones) each having a particular topic or theme to it
