# On Jobs 

This might seem obvious to some, but for me it's a major source of
frustration with people when talking about work or jobs, that they
think the way work culture developed after the war somehow is 
indicative of how it always was and always will be, and everyone, 
who thinks that the status quo as of now is sick and rotten, merely
wasn't working enough to truly understand why this culture of work is
tolerable, or even good.

Most of the time humans have been around, they have not "worked" some
retarded "job", because 99.99% the time hominids have been around, it 
was all hunting and gathering, which, also, was not only more natural
and fulfilling, but also took a lot less time than working some office
job. Most jobs these days are there so the people don't accidentally
enjoy their life for once and do something actually fulfilling. The 
Neolithic Revolution famously introduced many health problems, which
modern society, no matter how hard it tries, can't get rid of, or even
not exaggerate them to such an extreme that is also comedic.

Even before the war, most people just were farmers, and suffered from
that too, but not to the degree they do from modern job culture. This 
"Job culture" is just a sly, collective way of calling everyone who
doesn't work a parasite. This is what the working population truly thinks
about you, when you refuse to work. "Job culture" is Stockholm Syndrome
by the "working population" to feel better about themselves, when they're
slaves like everybody else. You don't sit on mountain of wealth/land/property,
you're just a slave everybody else, but for some reason you think you
being an asshole towards those beneath you is justified, because you're
one of the golems, one the fucking cogs that integrate into this perfectly
into the machine. "Job culture" is when you those beneath you for not
integrating well enough. "Job culture" has normalized doing something
utterly meaningless for most of the time, even risking your health and
happiness for it, because for some reason there is no greater shame
than not "working".
