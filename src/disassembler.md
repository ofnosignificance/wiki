A disassembler is a software tool that displays the assembly
instructions in a binary executable or object file. It works by going
over the file in question and reading each opcode byte by byte and
translating it the corresponding assembly instructions. Some debuggers
have a disassembling functionality, such as x64dbg or gdb, some
assemblers have disassemblers with them like nasm has ndisasm, z80asm
has z80dasm, and so forth.
