# On Hallucinations

I think what many people falsely assume about hallucinations, at least
in the realm of a mental health problem and not a drug trip, is that
you yourself think that you're hallucinating, because whilst 
hallucinating, you (I speak as "you", but I actually mean "me/I") 
don't feel like you're "out of touch with reality" or "insane", the
hallucination just integrates into your lived experience, and the 
moment you realize a discrepancy between your own lived experience, and
the one of everyone else, you start feeling like they are all wrong
and you are the only person who is right about this, as such the 
hallucinations always feels real. It's the same way nobody "insane" 
actually feels like an insane person with insane thoughts, they just
assume what they believe is right, and likewise you don't feel like
there is something off or wrong about your lived experience when you're
hallucinating.
