# Context
## Putting myself out there
I'm a hobby programmer for the most part, interested in low-level or
close-to-the-hardware programming. I never finish any projects, ever, 
so I don't feel like any of them warrant being documented here, as I
will give up on them anyway. Other than that, I'm interested in otaku
media, early human history, sometimes tinkering with electronics, and 
whatever else catches my attention, but those are interests, that 
have persisted over the years.

I speak German, English, and Czech (sorted in descening skill).

## Contact information
You can contact me over this email (written backwards; use the rev
