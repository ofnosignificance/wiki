Suckless is a cargo cult emphasizing what they call \"simplicity\",
\"unix philosophy\", and \"minimalism\". In practice this minimalism
looks like them writing the most trivial program imaginable and then
exclaiming how fucking awesome their code is for being aligned with all
their ideas how software should be. Their code is purposefully
undocumented and uncommented, which only works since their code base is
usually a few thousand lines. Suckless also attempted to make multiple
Suckless Linux distributions, among them one that had everything
statically linked resulting in an OS broken by design. Further, they
think software peaked in the 70s and call everything that isn\'t
structured like Unix System V bloat or something. It\'s remarkable how
they cannot imagine a future where software doesn\'t adhere to some
philosophy from almost half a century ago, as if that was the best thing
since sliced bread and couldn\'t possibly be improved upon or updated
(Note: I\'m myself against update culture, but there\'s a difference
between update culture and not using software written for ancient
mainframes). Surely, if you complete the temperature converter exercise
in the \"The C Programming Language\" book enough times, you will truly
understand how great software ought to be, but I digress. It\'s true, if
all programs you know are cat, sed, and cut, then there\'s not a point
in rethinking your ways, but if you want something like Sony Vegas or
IDA Pro, the Unix philosophy doesn\'t scale well and is not really
applicable to such programs at all. Those are mostly points from the
\"unix philosophy\" crowd, that a lot of suckless people subscribe
ideologically speaking, but there\'s more. Their software is configured
through source code, since they don\'t want any filthy nocoders even
using their software, Whether you like this gatekeeping measure is up to
you, I think it\'s good that one doesn\'t have to learn yet another
configuration file syntax, but then again, most configuration files
formats are more or less intuitive and require little reading.

Note 1: Some of them consider Plan 9 to be a good continuation of Unix,
so maybe it\'s not entirely true that they cannot imagine something that
isn\'t Unix from the 70s, however, Plan 9 is also not that different
from a design philosophy standpoint. Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s a
different philosophy, yet the core principles of it are the same.
