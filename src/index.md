# Welcome to eternal-monologue.net
The eternal-monologue is some guys consciousness streamlined into a
personal Wiki. No guarantees given for anything. I used to have plenty
of different old websites in the past, those, however, are gone now,
probably for good. I hope that this site, as much as it changed over
time, is a better place. Beware, I don\'t have a single clue about 
anything I write, I don\'t have a
diploma or degree in these things, I\'m just some idiot who likes to
read about these things. While I try to be as close to reality as
possible, it might not always be that, so send me an email if you think
that I\'m utterly retarded, have a love letter for me, or [just want
somebody to pilgrimage to the currently oldest tree known to
man](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=37.3794&mlon=-118.1618&zoom=15#map=17/37.377873/-118.163044)
